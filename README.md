A word about the code contained herein:

This is my first fully responsive React App and I'm really happy with what I've done given what I currently know.

However.

You know that book / movie where food fell from the sky? Okay. Imagine that happened. And it was spaghetti. Spaghetti literally everywhere as far as you can see.

That's pretty much my css file. I pulled a lot of references from other places and refactored them until everything looks pretty close to how I want it.

And one day it will be clean. Tidy, even. There will be helpful, insightful comments instead of ones that say "This makes everything disappear.".

Because one day I will know more than what I know now and will have had time to apply it.

Until then, watch out for the sauce puddles. A person could drown.
